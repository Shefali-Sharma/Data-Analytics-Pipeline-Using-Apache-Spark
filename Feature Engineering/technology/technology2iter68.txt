Advertisement Supported by By Tiffany Hsu Debates over privacy have plagued Facebook for years. But the news that  Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm that worked on President Trumpâ€™s 2016 campaign, was able to gain access to private data through the social network has sparked an unusually strong reaction among its users. The hashtag #DeleteFacebook appeared more than 10,000 times on Twitter within a two-hour period on Wednesday, according to the analytics service ExportTweet. On Tuesday, it was mentioned 40,398 times, according to the analytics service Digimind. Cher was one such deserter, writing on Twitter that the decision to quit Facebook, although â€œvery hard,â€� was necessary because she loves the United States. 2day I did something VERY HARD 4 me.Facebook has helped me with my Charity, &there are amazing young Ppl there.I have a special friend (Lauren)who I Respect & Admire,but today I deleted my Facebook account .I Love MyğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ğŸ™�ğŸ�».I Believe....There are Things MOREâ€�IMPORTANTâ€�THANğŸ’°ğŸ’° Brian Acton, a co-founder of the WhatsApp messaging service, told his tens of thousands of followers on Tuesday to delete Facebook. The social network acquired WhatsApp in a $19 billion deal in 2014. For people who arenâ€™t celebrities or billionaires, the decision to abandon Facebook came reluctantly, because the platform often served as their sole connection to certain relatives, friends and professional opportunities. Here, some newly Facebook-free users of social media discuss why they left. ______ Richard H. Perry A filmmaker in Los Angeles For a long time now, Mr. Perry had wanted to leave Facebook. He never felt comfortable knowing that the company had access to much of his personal information. In the months before the 2016 presidential election, he watched the social network become what he called â€œa garbage platform of ads and weird reposted articles and people that you care about exposing themselves as racists.â€� But Facebook was also where Mr. Perry promoted his films, where he posted ads seeking help on the set, and where he communicated with colleagues and a â€œmassive numberâ€� of his friends and relatives. Until he heard about Cambridge Analytica. â€œI suspected this stuff was going on, but this is the first time itâ€™s been plainly exposed,â€� he said. â€œIt seems so malicious, and Facebook seems so complicit all the way up and down, like it doesnâ€™t care about its users.â€� Mr. Perry, 39, has since deleted his profile and plans to switch to Twitter and Instagram for his social media needs. â€œIt was an easy decision,â€� he said. â€œItâ€™s not going to be the end of the world.â€� ______ Dan Clark A retired Navy veteran in Maine Mr. Clark kept one Facebook account to chat with friends and a separate account to keep tabs on members of his family nationwide. This week, he deleted both. â€œFacebook was the main platform I used to keep in touch with all of them, and it was a difficult decision to give it up,â€� he said. â€œBut you have to stand for something, so I just put my foot down and said enough is enough.â€� Mr. Clark, 57, said he had already been angry with Facebook for censoring some of his posts, which he said expressed his staunchly conservative views but were â€œnever evil or putting anybody down.â€� He could not abide the idea that his personal information was also being sold or given away without his consent. Before cutting the cord, Mr. Clark posted on Facebook inviting his contacts to ask him for his personal phone number. More than 100 people reached out within three days. â€œThere are just so many ways nowadays to stay in contact: phones, email, instant message, Gab, which is a social network that doesnâ€™t censor anything,â€� he said. â€œFacebook is more obsolete than people would think.â€� ______ Alexandra Kleeman A writer on Staten Island Her first experience with fake news â€” a Facebook post claiming that Pope Francis had endorsed Mr. Trumpâ€™s candidacy â€” altered the way Ms. Kleeman looked at Facebook. â€œIt changed the psychological and emotional feel of the platform for me,â€� she said. â€œI donâ€™t have a great feeling when I log in.â€� The Cambridge Analytica scandal led her to remove the Facebook app from her phone. â€œIâ€™m not going to give them my engagement clicks,â€� Ms. Kleeman, 32, said. But she is keeping the messaging function open for professional purposes and will continue using Instagram. She doesnâ€™t mind the idea that some personal data can be made public â€” she used to have a blog, she said. â€œBut the idea that my data could be used for purposes that I expressly donâ€™t want, that freaks me out.â€� ______ Paul Musgrave An assistant professor in Amherst, Mass. Twitter makes Mr. Musgrave feel depressed about the world, but Facebook is the social media platform he is trying to abandon. As a political science teacher at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, Mr. Musgrave, 36, feels a professional responsibility to keep abreast of the news and academic chatter hurtling at him in the form of tweets. Facebook was more valuable to him as a â€œlow-key, offstage networking tool,â€� a â€œreplacement for end-of-year family newslettersâ€� that allowed him to â€œpassively keep up with people,â€� he said. He joined the platform more than a decade ago and before that had been a member of Friendster, a precursor to Facebook. But in 2016, while helping his mother during her campaign for a government position in Indiana, Mr. Musgrave discovered a â€œpoisonous swampâ€� of content on the site. The Cambridge Analytica findings were even more disturbing, he said. "This is a company that has Orwellian levels of data about us, truly Big Brother-level, but itâ€™s behaving as if it has no social responsibility and is a purely neutral medium of communication,â€� he said. "Thatâ€™s whatâ€™s really been scary.â€� Having deactivated his Facebook account, with plans to delete it, he now worries about connecting with people who use the social network as their main conduit of communication. â€œIâ€™m definitely pruning myself away from some of those really important branches,â€� he said. â€œI watch my own students try to navigate the world of apps and smartphones, and even they donâ€™t really know how the internet works outside these enclosed garden spaces.â€� ______ Ben Greenzweig An entrepreneur in Westchester, N.Y. Once Mr. Greenzweig confirms that the 1,195 photos and 85 videos in his Facebook profile have downloaded, he plans to delete the account he has maintained for nearly a decade. Mr. Greenzweig, 40, said the Cambridge Analytica news was â€œthe last straw.â€� â€œWe have surpassed the tipping point, where the benefit now fails to outweigh the cost,â€� he said. â€œBut I will definitely miss what the promise of Facebook used to be â€” a way to connect to community in a very global and local context.â€� A year ago, Mr. Greenzweig was an â€œextraordinarily activeâ€� Facebook user who juggled conversations with friends, managed several groups, took out ads for his business and maintained professional contacts. But on Tuesday night, in his final post, he asked his network to connect with him through email, LinkedIn, Twitter or phone. â€œSee everyone in the real world,â€� he wrote.
