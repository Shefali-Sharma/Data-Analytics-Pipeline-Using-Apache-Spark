By Linda Qiu President Trump said Lisa Page, who may hold the record for the most Emails in the shortest period of time (to her Lover, Peter S), and attorney Baker, are out at the FBI as part of the Probers getting caught? Why is Peter S still there? What a total mess. Our Country has to get back to Business! The Facts This requires context. Mr. Trump is questioning why Lisa Page and James A. Baker, two former F.B.I. officials, left the bureau last week, seeming to suggest that their departures had something to do with their roles in the Russia investigation. The two lawyers had previously advised James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director.  But as The New York Times reported on May 4, their departures were voluntary and unrelated. And in Mr. Baker’s case, he told The Times that he would be writing for Lawfare, a national security law blog affiliated with the Brookings Institution.  Contrary to Mr. Trump’s suggestion, neither was forced out of the F.B.I. Though they were both at points involved in the Russia investigation, neither was part of the special counsel’s inquiry when they resigned. During the 2016 election, Ms. Page exchanged messages with Peter Strzok, an agent involved in the Russia investigation, that expressed views critical of Mr. Trump and other political figures.  Mr. Strzok was removed from the investigation last summer and reassigned to the F.B.I.’s human resources department. Linda Qiu is a fact-check reporter, based in Washington.
