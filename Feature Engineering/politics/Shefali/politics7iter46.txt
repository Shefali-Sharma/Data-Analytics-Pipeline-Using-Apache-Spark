INDIANA OHIO Columbus Indianapolis Cincinnati WEST VIRGINIA The candidates’ strategies have often boiled down to an extended presidential hug, with unsubtle efforts to attach their cause to Mr. Trump’s. These three races are among the Senate’s most competitive  	Lean Dem.  MT OH WI  	Tossup  AZ FL IN MO ND NV WV  	Lean Rep.  TN The winners will all face Democratic incumbents in November, in races that could determine the balance of the Senate: The Democrats up for re-election are vulnerable — all three states saw notable shifts to the right in 2016 — if only Republicans can avoid sabotaging themselves. KEY REP. PRIMARY CANDIDATES DEM. INCUMBENT Blankenship Jenkins Morrisey Manchin DEM. INCUMBENT KEY REP. PRIMARY CANDIDATES Blankenship Jenkins Morrisey Manchin Mr. Trump has made his choice. Sort of. He knows, at least, whom West Virginians should not vote for, starting his week with a Monday morning tweet urging them against supporting Don Blankenship, a former coal mining executive who spent a year in prison for his role in a fatal mining explosion. The president did not say Mr. Blankenship was unqualified, despite this history and a campaign premised at times on largely baseless attacks against Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader whom Mr. Blankenship has labeled “Cocaine Mitch.” Instead, Mr. Trump’s argument was electoral: Mr. Blankenship, he said, “can’t win” in a general election, even in a state that gave the president 68 percent of its vote in 2016. “Vote Rep. Jenkins or A.G. Morrisey!” Mr. Trump wrote, plugging the two more conventional Republican candidates, Representative Evan Jenkins and Attorney General Patrick Morrisey. They are hoping to take on Senator Joe Manchin III, a Democrat who has aligned himself at times with Mr. Trump. But Mr. Trump’s tweet speaks to the challenge of stopping an insurgent like Mr. Blankenship: The others can become almost indistinguishable, leaving room for an upset. A recent Fox News poll showed Mr. Blankenship in third place in a fluid race, with many voters still undecided. Republicans in Washington have taken no chances, fearful that a victory by Mr. Blankenship could doom their chances to claim an eminently winnable seat. A “super PAC” linked to the party establishment has attacked Mr. Blankenship as a “convicted criminal” and a hypocrite. Mr. Blankenship has held up his own deeply checkered background — and the establishment forces arrayed against him — as evidence that he is even “Trumpier than Trump.” KEY REP. PRIMARY CANDIDATES DEM. INCUMBENT Braun Messer Rokita Donnelly DEM. INCUMBENT KEY REP. PRIMARY CANDIDATES Braun Messer Rokita Donnelly Senator Joe Donnelly, an endangered Democrat in a solidly red state, has surely enjoyed this Republican primary. Political reporters have exhausted their quota of boxing metaphors — “bruising,” “bloody,” full of debate-night “jabs” — to describe a three-way Republican campaign (no, a fifteen-round brawl) that includes two congressmen, Representatives Luke Messer and Todd Rokita, and a business executive named Mike Braun. They are not getting along royally. And there is at least some fear among Republican strategists that the wounds will not heal fully by November. Mr. Messer and Mr. Rokita have been rivals since college, rising in state politics on parallel tracks. Mr. Rokita’s campaign has labeled Mr. Messer a “Never Trump lobbyist.” Mr. Messer has accused Mr. Rokita of “trying to make things up,” insisting he has never wavered in his support for the president. Mr. Braun, pitching himself as the Trump-like businessman in the bunch, has dismissed his rivals as professional politicians — lawyers who “never practiced.” The result, for several weeks now, has often been a free ride for Mr. Donnelly, who certainly should be vulnerable, given the state’s electoral drift. Barack Obama won the state in 2008, but lost by double digits in 2012. Mr. Trump won Indiana by 19 points. KEY REP. PRIMARY CANDIDATES DEM. INCUMBENT Renacci Gibbons Brown DEM. INCUMBENT KEY REP. PRIMARY CANDIDATES Renacci Gibbons Brown In this state, at least, Mr. Trump has cleared up the matter of which candidate gets to credibly trade on his name. That would be Representative Jim Renacci, a wealthy auto dealer, whose campaign the president blessed last month. “I need Jim very badly to help our agenda,” Mr. Trump tweeted. Mr. Renacci’s chief competition in the primary is Mike Gibbons, a Cleveland-area businessman. But while Mr. Trump carried the state by eight points in 2016, Ohio is regarded as far more of a bellwether than West Virginia or Indiana — a state where a full embrace of Mr. Trump carries at least some risk in a general election. Senator Sherrod Brown, the Democrat seeking re-election, is the only member of his party holding high office in the state. A longtime critic of pacts like the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mr. Brown has negotiated the state’s recent rightward tilt, in part, with an appreciation for Mr. Trump’s instincts on trade. But he has been far less inclined than Mr. Manchin or Mr. Donnelly, the Democratic incumbents in West Virginia and Indiana, to side with the president on key personnel selections, like Justice Neil Gorsuch or Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, prompting Republican attacks that Mr. Brown is in league with his party’s most obstructionist wing. Ohio’s most-watched contest on Tuesday is elsewhere on the ballot. The state’s governor, John R. Kasich, is term-limited. And both parties have seen competitive, rollicking primaries to succeed him. On the Democratic side, it’s Richard Cordray — a former director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with the endorsement of Senator Elizabeth Warren — against Dennis Kucinich, the eccentric septuagenarian former “boy mayor” of Cleveland, who later became a congressman and presidential candidate. The party establishment has lined up behind Mr. Cordray, though several allies of Senator Bernie Sanders are with Mr. Kucinich. For Republicans, the favorite is Mike DeWine, the state’s attorney general, but he has faced a formidable challenge from Mary Taylor, the lieutenant governor. Despite her current office, Ms. Taylor has taken care not to associate too closely with Mr. Kasich, whose criticisms of Mr. Trump have made him largely toxic in a Republican primary. Advertisement
