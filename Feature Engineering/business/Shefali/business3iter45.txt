The automotive business posted order intake of 11 billion euros ($13.10 billion), driven mainly by components and systems to help cars become safer and more intelligent, Chief Financial Officer Wolfgang Schaefer told Reuters on Tuesday. "I am confident that we will have a strong order intake which supports our targets," Schaefer said. Brake systems, driver assistance technologies and vehicle displays for interiors were among the products driving demand, Schaefer said. Continental affirmed its guidance for 2018 sales of around 47 billion euros before exchange-rate effects and a margin on adjusted earnings before interest and tax of more than 10 percent. Continental will provide a strategic update about its plans to implement a new structure by mid-year, Schaefer said, declining to provide further details.
