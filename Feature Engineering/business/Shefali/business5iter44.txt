G4S, which provides outsourced services such as guarding, security and cash management, said it was building up a strong pipeline in its retail cash solutions business in North America and overall trading in line with its full-year targets.  "We expect growth to accelerate in the second half of 2018 as the strong first-half comparatives from Retail Cash Solutions roll off, our new contracts mobilise and our productivity programmes deliver benefits to the bottom line," said ChiefExecutive Ashley Almanza.
