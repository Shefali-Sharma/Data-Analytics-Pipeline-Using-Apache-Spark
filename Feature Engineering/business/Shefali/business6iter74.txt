Advertisement Supported by By Reuters (Reuters) - Shares in Danish healthcare products company Coloplast rose five percent on Thursday after the company posted underlying quarterly sales growth above expectations and nudged its 2017-2018 sales forecast higher. Coloplast, which makes products ranging from urine bags to wound dressings, reported underlying sales growth in the second quarter of 8 percent, above the 7 percent expected by analysts. The company said it now expects a full year underlying sales growth of 7-8 percent up from previously 7 percent. Its financial year runs until the end of September.  "Coloplast sacrificed its earnings a while back to pursue organic growth, but the growth hadn't materialized in recent quarters. It came this quarter and in combination with a small upgrade, that's what pulling the stock higher," said Michael Friis Jorgensen, Alm. Brand Markets. Shares in Coloplast were trading 4.4 percent higher at 560.2 Danish crowns each by 1135 GMT, having hit their the highest level in six months.  Operating profit for the period stood at 1.2 billion Danish crowns (142 million pounds), compared with the 1.24 billion expected by analysts. The Wound & Skin Care part of the business, however, had a disappointing second quarter, reporting a revenue of 533 million crowns, below the 557 million crowns expected by analysts.
