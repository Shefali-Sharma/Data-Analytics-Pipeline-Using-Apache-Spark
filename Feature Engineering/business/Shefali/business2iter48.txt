"Like other economic players, we are following the evolution of the matter, and are also following the EU's official position on this topic," said a spokesman for PSA, adding that PSA hoped the EU's position regarding Iran would be a "singular" one. On May 8, President Donald Trump on Tuesday pulled the United States out of an international nuclear deal with Iran, raising the risk of conflict in the Middle East, upsetting European allies and casting uncertainty over global oil supplies. France, which has had close business ties with Iran since before the fall of the Shah in 1979, has sought to deepen trade ties since sanctions against Iran were lifted in 2016. Major French companies operating in Iran include PSA, rival carmaker Renault and oil major Total, while Airbus has also won orders from IranAir.
