Through interviews, public records and documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, The New York Times and ProPublica have identified many current and former appointees to these groups. An investigation has revealed a string of possible conflicts, including some hires who may be reviewing rules their previous employers tried to weaken or kill, and others who may personally profit if certain regulations were changed.
