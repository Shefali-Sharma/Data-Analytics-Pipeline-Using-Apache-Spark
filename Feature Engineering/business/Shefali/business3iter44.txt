Advertisement Supported by By Reuters (Reuters) - President Donald Trump has pulled the United States out of an international nuclear deal with Iran, sealed in 2015, and said he would re-impose economic sanctions on Iran. Some sanctions take effect after a 90-day "wind-down" period ending on Aug. 6, and the rest, most notably on the petroleum sector, after a 180-day "wind-down period" ending on Nov. 4. Both deadlines are meant to give firms and other entities time to conclude trade and other business activities with or in Iran, the U.S. Treasury Department said on Tuesday. Below are reactions to Tuesday's decision from companies most likely to be affected by the move to reimpose sanctions.
